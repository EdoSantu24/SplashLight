## Hardware Team

### Step 1, Initial hardware circuit
To set a foundation for the project, a simple circuit needs to be built for every team to use
- ESP32
- Button
- Battery (it has to be in the range between 3.3V and 4.?)
- Visual/audible warning (LED or beep-thingy)
- be careful with matching the voltage of the different devices (e.g, GNSS module could require too much power from the ESP-Lora Module, careful)

---

### Our responsibilities
- Optimize code, for the sake of battery life
- 3D-printing
- Hardware setup of lighting and stuff

---

### 3D-Printed enclosure
- Notes will be added as the project continues
